Those, who got a chance to work with me, know how big of a fan of vim\* I am. So far, though, I have been mainly using it plainly without much additions or plugins. Well, maybe a couple to be completely honest; for instance for ctags and cscope bindings, etc.

In the past couple of days, I came across Vifm and gave it a try. I liked it but I didn't really like how its vim plugin just deliberately messed some typical vim-configurations up. For example, like vim being directly in insert mode when it starts! I mean who uses vim and wants that? (No offense to anyone who would).

So anyway, a few researchs led me to learn about [netwrw](https://vimhelp.org/pi_netrw.txt.html) and its [:Explore](https://vimhelp.org/pi_netrw.txt.html#netrw-explore) command. Some experimentations later, I now have and IDE-Mode in my vimrc to be toggled using alt-i. This still needs a lot of enhancements and adjustments, and me be even better be moved to its own .vim file.

## This is how my .vimrc looks for now:
```vim
"Colorscheme
colorscheme torte
set colorcolumn=80

"Syntax
syn on
set tabstop=4 shiftwidth=4 expandtab
set hlsearch
set ruler

"syntastic python configuaration
let g:syntastic_python_checkers=['flake8']

let g:netrw_banner = 0
let g:netrw_liststyle = 3
let g:netrw_browse_split = 4
"let g:netrw_browse_split = [,,2]
let g:netrw_altv = 1
let g:netrw_winsize = 15

let g:ide_active = 0

function! IdeMode()
  if g:ide_active == 0
    let g:ide_active = 1
    :Vexplore
    :wincmd l
    :rightbelow term bash
    :resize 15
    :2wincmd w
    set number
    :TagbarToggle
    ":echo "IDE mode activated."
  else
    let g:ide_active = 0
    :3wincmd w
    :q!
    :2wincmd w
    :only!
    set nonumber
    ":echo "IDE mode deactivated."
  endif
endfunction

nmap <M-i> :call IdeMode()<CR>
map <F12> :call IdeMode()<CR>
map <F8> TagbarToggle<CR>
```
_You see, I am also using [TagbarToggle](https://majutsushi.github.io/tagbar/) there. A useful plugin in my opinion._


\**Just to be clear, I am not putting any thoughts on the Vi vs. Emacs war. And frankly, I have never given Emacs a try. I just started with vim a long time ago, and it has grown on me.*
