Since I tend to use grep a lot at work, I decided to take a look at Vim's grep-bindings. Be it the internal grep (:vimgrep) or the external (:grep), I found the process to be tedious and full of repititions to first have to run it (possibly even by search for a spicific text from the current buffer), then open the errors or locations window to see the result, so I decided to automate the whole process using a map (well ... four maps):

```vim
nnoremap <M-g>w :lvimgrep /\v<C-r><C-w>/j **<CR>:lopen 10<CR>
nnoremap <M-g>e :lvimgrep /\v<<C-r><C-w>>/j **<CR>:lopen 10<CR>
vnoremap <M-g>w y:lvimgrep /\v<C-R>=escape(@",'/\')<CR>/j **<CR>:lopen 10<CR>
vnoremap <M-g>e y:lvimgrep /\v<<C-R>=escape(@",'/\')<CR>>/j **<CR>:lopen 10<CR>
```

Here, there are basically two new shortcuts or mappings ```Alt+g - w``` and ```Alt+g - e```. And these two then twice; once for the normal mode and another for visual mode.

```Alt+g``` stands for **<ins>g</ins>**rep, ```w``` for **<ins>w</ins>**ord and ```e``` for (word) **<ins>e</ins>**nd.

When in normal word, the word under the cursor is being searched for. While in visual mode, the selected test is copied and used as the regular expression.
'w' and 'e' differ in that the first searches for the word as is (without adding boundaries) while the latter adds the word boundary symbols around the expression.

What I still have on my mind, is automate the process from the command line as well, so that vim is started directly with the search results opened in the locations window.
