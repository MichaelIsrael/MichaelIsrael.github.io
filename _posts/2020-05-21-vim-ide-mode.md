After experimenting a bit with [creating an IDE-like setup in vim](/posts/vim-as-ide/), I decided to enhance a bit because I found it to be useful for me. Bit by bit, it grew till I had to move it to its own file. So without further ado, I present to you: [IdeMode.vim](https://github.com/MichaelIsrael/IdeMode.vim).
<Br>I guess this is the beginning of a vim plugin. It's still in its initialy rudimentary state. But I already use it extensively.

<Br>It's not documented for now, i.e., no vim documentation, but the [README](https://github.com/MichaelIsrael/IdeMode.vim/blob/master/README.md) file in the repository says it all for now. Nevertheless, documentation is on my [TODO list](https://github.com/MichaelIsrael/IdeMode.vim/blob/master/TODO.md).
