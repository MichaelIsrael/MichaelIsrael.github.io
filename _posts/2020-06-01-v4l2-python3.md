While I was updating [CaSys](https://github.com/MichaelIsrael/CaSys), I found myself in need of reading the capabilities of a video device. This is normally done in C using the v4l2 driver and ioctl. I Googled a bit and found a very rudimentary python module, namingly [v4l2](https://pypi.org/project/v4l2/), that implemented the interface in ```linux\videodev.h``` in a Python file. The only problem was it only works with Python2, which is even no longer supported. The fix wasn't so complicated. It was all about the changes made to ```range```.

So anyway, I forked the project ([from bazaar to git](/posts/bzr-to-git)) commited and pushed the fix, and decided to send the diff-patch to the original authors / the current maintainers, only to find the project half-dead. I mean the last update in the main branch was ten years ago (I already knew that), but then of course I wasn't the first to run across this problems. There is already a [bug](https://bugs.launchpad.net/python-v4l2/+bug/1664158) filed in Launchpad for this, with a patch for a fix. Just the changes were never reviewed or applied into mainline. And hence the Python package remains obsolete. I am now seriously considering implementing a different package for Python3 that maybe even adds a few comfort-functions. We'll see if I will have time to get back to it.
